Apolcalyptic Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Your spell becomes infused with the devastating horror personified by the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, temporarily transforming reality into a treacherous ruin.																									MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:You can alter a spell with an area of effect and a duration of instantaneous to become an apocalyptic spell. When you cast the spell, the area affected by the spell’s instantaneous effect becomes ruined and devastated in appearance. All surfaces in the area are treated as difficult terrain, and Climb, Fly, and Swim checks attempted in the area take a penalty equal to the spell’s original spell level. The difficult terrain and skill penalties last for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s original spell level. An apocalyptic spell gains the evil descriptor. An apocalyptic spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the good descriptor can’t be apocalyptic spells.
Archon Diversion				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes																								PREMULT:1,[PREATT:4],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=3]																																																																																																																										DESC:You throw yourself in front of blows meant for allies, giving those allies a chance to strike back against the enemy once they have attacked you.																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to –1. Once per round while using Archon Style, when you have at least one hand free or when wielding a shield, you can divert one melee weapon attack targeting an adjacent ally to yourself. After resolving the attack, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed. You must choose to divert the attack after the opponent has declared the melee attack, but before the attack roll is rolled.
Archon Justice				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:4,CATEGORY=FEAT,Archon Diversion,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes																						PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=7]																																																																																																																										DESC:Attacking you during your period of vigilance opens foes up to allies’ strikes.																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:You no longer take a penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC, and you can activate this effect as a swift action or a move action. Whenever you take damage from an attack you diverted to yourself using Archon Diversion, each ally threatening the attacking creature can make an attack of opportunity against that creature.
Archon Style				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise,Combat Reflexes																											PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=1]																																																																																																																										DESC:You protect your allies from harm, even at the cost of your own safety.																																								MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent’s next melee attack [as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn], but causes you to take a –2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus against the designated opponent’s attacks persists even if your allies move away from you.
Authoritative Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Your magic holds all the intricacies of Axis’s idealized laws, enforcing their strictures upon your enemies																																	MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:2	SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become an authoritative spell. When you cast an authoritative spell, choose one of the following activities to prohibit: move closer to you, move away from you, make a melee weapon attack, make a ranged weapon attack, cast an offensive spell, or cast a nonoffensive spell. A creature that is affected by the spell and fails its saving throw against that spell [if the spell allows a saving throw to resist] cannot perform any action of the selected type on its next turn. An authoritative spell gains the lawful descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. An authoritative spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the chaotic descriptor can’t be authoritative spells.
Axiomatic Discourse			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:2,Diplomacy=3,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																													DESC:You take inspiration from the greatest debaters and speakers of Axis and weave words with precision, limiting misunderstandings and sharpening comprehension.																									MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:You can activate this feat’s benefits as part of a Diplomacy check to influence a creature’s attitude [before determining the outcome]. If you fail the Diplomacy check, the target’s attitude towards you does not decrease unless you fail the check by 10 or more. Also, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to influence creatures that do not understand your language, but you take a –4 penalty on the check. Once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge [planes], you can attempt a Diplomacy check twice and take the better result.
Azata Mischeif				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:4,CATEGORY=FEAT,Agile Maneuvers,Azata Style,Dodge,Mobility											PREATT:6																																																																																																																																													DESC:You move with uncommon grace that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.																																	MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:25														BENEFIT:While using Azata Style, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement [such as that granted by the Mobility feat].
Azata Sprint				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:6,CATEGORY=FEAT,Agile Maneuvers,Azata Mischief, Azata Style, Dodge, Mobility, Windstance						PREATT:10																																																																																																																																													DESC:You move across the battlefield in a blur.																																													MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:While using Azata Style, your base speed increases by 10 feet and you ignore the movement penalties applied by the first 10 feet of difficult terrain you move through in the round.
Azata Style					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility																PREATT:2																																																																																																																																													DESC:Your quickness and grace keep you alive																																													MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:While using this style, during any round in which you move at least 15 feet, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
Blazing Aura				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Conduit																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:You cover yourself in coils of flame drawn from the Plane of Fire																																									MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can shroud yourself in fire. Until the end of your turn, whenever a creature makes a successful melee attack against you, that creature takes a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 plus half your ranks in Knowledge [planes]; attacks made using reach weapons ignore this effect. A creature can halve this fire damage with a successful Reflex save [DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier]. You can use this feat’s benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. If you have at least 9 ranks in Knowledge [planes], activating this ability is a move action. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge [planes], you can activate this ability as a move action or a swift action.
Blissful Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:The absolute peace of Nirvana infuses your spells, giving pause to foes and granting boldness to allies																																		MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become a blissful spell, although the exact effects of the metamagic vary depending on whether the spell is beneficial or offensive. A creature successfully hit by an offensive blissful spell [if the spell requires an attack roll] or that fails its saving throw against an offensive blissful spell takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. A beneficial blissful spell instead grants affected creatures a +2 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for 1 round in addition to its normal effects. A blissful spell gains the good descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A blissful spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the evil descriptor can’t be blissful spells.
Channel Deific Essence			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																					PREALIGN:Deity									PREDOMAIN:1,ANY				PREMULT:1,[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelPositiveEnergyDice,5],[PREVARGTEQ:ClericChannelNegativeEnergyDice,5],[PREVARGTEQ:OracleChannelDice,5]																																																																																																										DESC:Rather than bringing forth positive or negative energy to heal allies or blast undead, you channel a fraction of your deity’s power into yourself																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend a use of channel energy to select a domain you have. You gain the ability associated with that domain from the invoke deity spell [see page 41] for a number of rounds equal to your number of channel energy dice. While this ability is active, taking actions directly opposed to your deity’s teachings or alignment causes you to take the penalties listed in invoke deity and ends this effect. You can gain only one ability from this feat at a time, and its effects do not stack with invoke deity. If you instead expend two uses of channel energy, you can instead infuse a single willing target within 30 feet with deific essence. The target need not be a worshiper of your deity, but is subject to the same penalties if it takes actions directly opposed to your deity’s teachings or alignment.
Chaos Reigns				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:The Abyss dreams of devastation; the slightest taste of its power is an incitement to bare-fisted violence.																																		MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can allow Abyssal wrath to overtake you. While in this state, you can use one of your hands as a slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 for Small creatures). A creature that does not have hands can instead use a different part of its body to make this slam attack. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Crypt Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:You can infuse your magic with the unswayable power of the Boneyard, sending foes to face ineluctable judgment.																																	MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	SOURCEPAGE:26														BENEFIT:You can enhance any spell that inflicts hit point damage to become a crypt spell. A creature that dies within 1 round of being damaged by a crypt spell is considered to have been killed by a death effect for the purpose of being returned to life. An undead creature damaged by a crypt spell gains the sickened condition for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s original spell level; this duration is halved if the undead creature succeeds at its saving throw against the spell. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can attempt a Will save to negate the sickened effect. A crypt spell gains the death descriptor. A crypt spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level.
Death Field					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5																																																																																															DESC:The deadly power of the Negative Energy Plane creates a field that snuffs out life forces at the cost of your own vitality.																															MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:As a move action, you can exude deadly energyfrom your body. While this death field is in effect, small plants wither and recoil from you, allowing you to ignore the effects of difficult terrain caused by plant life and ignore the effects of spells like entangle that compel vegetation to grasp at you, provided the spell’s level is 3rd or lower [the death field cannot affect more powerful plant magic]. Any swarm that enters your space takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage; this damage is applied before you are affected by any swarm attacks, so if the damage is enough to destroy the swarm, it does not harm you. At the end of your turn each round the death field is active, you take 1 point of negative energy damage, and you cannot be healed by positive energy effects while the death field is in place. Magic items and spells that protect against negative energy damage do not protect against this damage, but if you are undead or have negative energy affinity [or a similar ability], the death field instead grants fast healing 1 while it is in effect. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. These rounds need not be consecutive. If you have at least 11 ranks in Knowledge [planes], you can activate your death field as a swift action.
Demonic Momentum				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Demonic Style,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack										PREATT:5																																																																																																																																													DESC:You slam into foes with devastating force, leaving them vulnerable to your vicious strikes.																																				MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:While using Demonic Style, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls against that opponent for every 5 feet it was moved by your bull rush. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn, and it stacks with the damage bonus granted by Demonic Style.
Demonic Slaughter				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:6,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cleave,Demonic Momentum,Demonic Style,Great Cleave,Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack				PREATT:9																																																																																																																																													DESC:You punch into your foes’ ranks and cut them down.																																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:While using Demonic Style, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you can immediately use Great Cleave as though you had used a standard action to do so. This occurs after the effect of your bull rush is fully resolved. The target of your bull rush must be the target of the first attack you make as part of Great Cleave.
Demonic Style				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																PREATT:1																																																																																																																																													DESC:Self-preservation is irrelevant in the face of your fury.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:While using this style, when you use the charge action, the bonus on your attack roll increases by 1 and you deal 2 additional points of damage with melee attacks made as part of the charge. Special: If you have the rage or bloodrage class feature, you can enter Demonic Style’s stance as part of the free action to enter a rage. If you do, the style stance ends when your rage ends.
Diabolic Humiliation			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Diabolic Style,Vital Strike																									PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=7]]																																																																																																										DESC:Your humiliating strikes decrease a foe’s morale.																																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:When you successfully stagger a foe with an unarmed strike using Diabolic Style, the target becomes further humiliated. The target cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 1 minute after being staggered in this way, and for the duration of that minute, any additional staggered effects it suffers from your attacks of opportunity last for 2 rounds rather than 1. The durations of multiple staggered effects administered in this way stack. Special: A monk of at least 10th level with this feat can select Improved Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Diabolic Judgement			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:5,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes,Diabolic Humiliation,Diabolic Style,Improved Vital Strike,Vital Strike																		PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:12],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=11]]																																																																																																										DESC:You punish your foes for every opportunity they present.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:While using Diabolic Style, the first time each round that you successfully hit with an attack of opportunity, you can apply the effects of any Vital Strike feat you have to that attack. Special: A monk of at least 14th level with this feat can select Greater Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Diabolic Style				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Style		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes																													PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike,Weapon Focus (Unarmed Strike)],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=1]]																																																																																																										DESC:You utilize combat as an opportunity to inflict humiliation upon those who provoke your attacks of opportunity.																																	MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:27														BENEFIT:While using this style, you can make an attack of opportunity with an unarmed strike to deliver a humiliating swat to the target. If you hit the target, you inflict 1 point of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw [DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier] or become staggered for 1 round. Special: A monk of at least 6th level with this feat can select Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
Flickering Step				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=9																																																																																															DESC:You can appear and disappear in the blink of an eye.																																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:You can use dimension door as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your ranks in Knowledge [planes]. You can’t teleport a distance greater than twice your base speed in this way, and you must have both line of sight and line of effect to your destination. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge [planes]. A fighter with this feat treats Dimensional Agility and any feat that lists it as a prerequisite as though they were combat feats when selecting fighter bonus feats.
Gloomstorm					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Conduit																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=4																																																																																															DESC:An inexhaustible arsenal lies in the Shadow Plane, waiting to be unleashed.																																							MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can thin the barriers between yourself and the Shadow Plane, allowing you to create shadow weapons more easily. While this effect is active, you can create new shadow weapons as a free action. This does not increase the number of shadow weapons you can maintain at a single time. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
#Gloomstorm needs the Shadow Weapon class feature added once it's built as an achetype
CATEGORY=Feat|Grasping Tail.MOD					TYPE:General																																																																																PRETEXT:You must have a tail.																																																																																		DESC:Your tail becomes more useful, and can be used to grab or hold small items.																																							MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:You can use your tail to grab stowed items. While you cannot wield weapons with your tail, you can use it to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action. BENEFIT:If you have the prehensile tail tiefling racial trait, you can use your tail to grab unattended items within 5 feet or stowed objects carried on your person as a swift action; you can hold such objects with your tail, though you cannot manipulate them with it (other than to put them in your hand).|PRERACE:1,Tiefling
Gravitational Vital Strike		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat																																							PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike,Heavy Gravity Acclimation],[PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vital Strike,Light Gravity Acclimation]																																																																																																								DESC:You use unusual gravities to adjust your vital strikes.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:When using any Vital Strike feat in an area of light or heavy gravity, roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack one additional time. For example, if using Improved Vital Strike, you would roll the weapon’s damage dice for the attack four times before adding other damage bonuses, instead of three times. You must have the appropriate prerequisite feat associated with the plane’s gravity trait to gain this benefit.
Greater Planer Infusion			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit		PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Planar Infusion,Planar Infusion																						PRELEVEL:MIN=13																																																																																																																																	DESC:You have mastered the powers of another plane.																																												MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:Choose a plane for which you’ve gained an improved infusion via Improved Planar Infusion. You gain that plane’s greater infusion as well.
#Greater Planar Infusion will need to be changed to MULT:YES and given a CHOOSE tag for planes slected from the base and improved Planar Infusion feats
Greater Subjective Slam			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Subjective Slam,Subjective Mobility																										PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,MONK=7]																																PRESTAT:2,CON=15,WIS=15																																																																																							DESC:Your gravitational impact is meteoric, and your ability to use the act of falling devastating.																																				MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:When using Subjective Slam, you take only a –1 penalty on the combat maneuver check for every 100 feet of falling speed, and the maximum damage for such a slam increases to 12d6.
Healer's Hands				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:2,Heal=1,Knowledge (Planes)=1																																																																																														DESC:Your healing efforts are bolstered by positive energy.																																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT:You can use the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds as a full-round action. You do not take a penalty for not using a healer’s kit when treating deadly wounds this way, and you can do so on a given creature more than once per day. When treating deadly wounds this way, if your result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, add your ranks in Knowledge (planes) to the damage healed. These benefits do not apply to creatures that are not healed by positive energy. You can use this feat’s benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).
Heaven's Light				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=1																																																																																															DESC:You are a luminous beacon in the darkness, an icon of order and kindness through which the light of Heaven itself can shine, even in the most dreadful of realms.																									MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:28														BENEFIT: As a standard action, you can emit an aura of bright light centered on a glowing halo above or behind your head. The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a torch. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a daylight spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
Heavy Gravity Acclimation		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																						PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,STR=17],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance]																																																																																																																					DESC:Your muscles work overtime in areas with heavy gravity.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:29														BENEFIT:You do not take the normal penalties for being on heavy gravity planes. At the GM’s discretion, this effect may apply to certain environments on the Material Plane, such as high-gravity planets. In addition, your Strength is considered to be 4 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity.
Hollow Soul					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=9																																																																																															DESC:You can temporarily replace your soul with a fragment of the all-consuming void of Abaddon.																																				MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:29														BENEFIT:As a move action, you can enter a state of emotional and spiritual hollowness. While in this state, you react to positive and negative energy as if you were undead— positive energy harms you, while negative energy heals you. Whenever you are targeted by an effect that specifically affects living creatures or undead creatures, or that affects both in different ways, you have a 50%% chance to count as an undead creature rather than a living creature. You are immune to effects that specifically target your soul (such as trap the soul). However, while under the effect of this feat, you cannot benefit from beneficial mind-affecting effects, morale bonuses, or bardic performances. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Improved Planar Infusion		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Planar Infusion																										PRELEVEL:MIN=7																																																																																																																																	DESC:Your connection to the planes has grown stronger.

Improved Plane Shift			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																										PRECLASS:1,Wizard=9																																																																																																																																									DESC:You’re an expert at traveling the various realms of the Great Beyond via plane shift.																																					MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:Add plane shift to your spell list and to your spellbook as a 5th-level wizard spell. The time required for you to identify a portal’s destination is reduced to 1 round. In addition, you automatically identify any plane on which you arrive. A wizard can select this as a wizard bonus feat.
#Figure out how to reduce the spell level of Plane Shift, figure out how to make this elibible as a wizard bonus feat
Lashing Tail				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Grasping Tail																																																																								PRETEXT:You must have a tail.																																																																																		DESC:Your tail is either thick and heavy enough to serve as a weapon, or else is adorned with barbs or quills that weaponize its lashing length.																												MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30	NATURALATTACKS:Tail,Weapon.Natural.Melee.Piercing.Slashing.Bludgeoning,*1,1d6	BENEFIT:You gain a tail slap natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for your size (1d6 points for a Medium creature, or 1d4 points for a small creature). When you first gain this feat, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing; this is the type of damage your tail inflicts, and it cannot be later changed. Due to the inherent awkwardness of attacking with your tail, you can’t make a tail slap attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack. Treat your tail slap attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured weapon as part of a full-attack action.
#Lashing Tail's natural weapon not set up correctly. Needs to be adjusted to respect Small vs Medium size, needs some sort of CHOOSE to define Piercing/Slashing/Bludgeoning
Last Rites					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (Planes)=3,Knowledge (Religion)=3																																																																																											DESC:You offer a path to the Boneyard for the walking dead and restless spirits.																																							MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against any haunt or against an undead creature with the resurrection vulnerability weakness. This touch attack deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to the undead creature or haunt (ignoring damage reduction and hardness); a creature damaged this way is staggered for 1 round. You must have detected the haunt with a successful skill check or identified the undead creature with a successful Knowledge (religion) check to use this ability. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes). In addition, the amount of damage you deal with this ability increases by 1d6 for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
Light Gravity Acclimation		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Acrobatics=3							PRESTAT:1,DEX=13																																																																																								DESC:A realm’s light gravity lets you reach your full potential.																																									MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:Your land speed increases by 10 feet while on a plane with light gravity, and other creatures do not gain a circumstance bonus on attack rolls against you from light gravity. At the GM’s discretion, these effects might apply to certain environments on the Material Plane, such as low-gravity planets. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks; if you have 10 or more ranks in Acrobatics, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with that provided by the Acrobatic feat.
Malleable Form				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=7																																																																																															DESC:You infuse your body with protoplasm from the Maelstrom.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can infuse yourself with protoplasm, converting your body and equipment to a semi-gelatinous state. You gain the compression universal monster ability, which allows you to move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing or oneeighth your space when squeezing. You also gain a bonus to your CMD against grapple and trip combat maneuvers equal to half your ranks in Knowledge (planes). Due to your form’s softness and instability, your attacks with manufactured weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes deal half damage while you are in malleable form. This effect offers no protection against critical hits or precision damage. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Mischievous Tail				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Grasping Tail																																																																				PRESTAT:1,DEX=15		PRETEXT:You must have a tail.																																																																																		DESC:Your tail seems to have a mind of its own.																																													MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:You can use your tail for all purposes as though it were a free hand, though you cannot effectively wield weapons or shields with it (you can still carry such objects with your tail, as long as such an object could also be comfortably carried in a hand normally). In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on disarm and steal combat maneuvers and Sleight of Hand checks performed using only your tail, and combat maneuvers performed this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Open Conduit				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																						PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:2,RACETYPE=Outsider,RACESUBTYPE=Native],[PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5]																																																																																																																	DESC:You can draw forth planar energies with unparalleled ease.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:30														BENEFIT:Select a conduit feat you have. When determining the uses per day or the amount of time per day you can use this conduit feat, you are treated as though you had an additional 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes). This does not offer any other benefit or affect other uses of Knowledge (planes). You can select this feat more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select it, choose another conduit feat to gain its benefits.
#Open Conduit needs it's MULT changed to YES and given a CHOOSE tag for conduit type feats taken
Peace of Mind				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:The blissful peace of Nirvana is never more than a thought away from your mind.																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:As an immediate action when you fail a saving throw against an emotion, fear, or pain effect, you can ignore the effect and instead become dazed for an amount of time equal to twice the duration of the original effect. Any nonlethal damage you would have taken from the original effect is reduced to its minimum value (as though a 1 had been rolled on all dice). You cannot activate this ability if you are currently dazed. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
Phasestrike					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Conduit																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=10																																																																																															DESC:You strike through the Ethereal Plane so your weapon phases through obstacles, armor, and even thick hide to strike true.																															MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:As a move action, you can phase out one manufactured weapon or piece of ammunition you are holding. The next melee attack or thrown ranged attack you make with that weapon before the end of your turn is resolved as a touch attack and ignores cover, but does not ignore armor bonuses from force effects. You can attack through total cover this way, although you must still select the correct square for your target. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 10 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes). This feat does not function on planes that are not coterminous with the Ethereal Plane.
Planar Heritage				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																															PRERACE:1,HUMAN																																																																																																					DESC:You can trace your ancestry to a type of native outsider, even though you yourself are otherwise fully human.																																	MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:Choose one type of native outsider (such as ganzi). You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if you choose ganzi, you are considered both a human and a ganzi for the purposes of taking traits, meeting feat prerequisites, determining how spells and magic items affect you, and so on. You must have the requisite physical features to gain certain benefits, as determined by the GM (for example, you cannot gain feats that augment your tail’s abilities if you do not actually have a tail). You cannot select Planar Heritage if you already have an ability or feat (like Racial Heritage) that adjusts your heritage in this way.
Planar Infusion				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																																PRETEXT:You must spend a significant amount of time on a plane other than your home plane or the Material Plane. Typically, this amount of time should coincide with an adventure set on that plane, but at the GM’s discretion, you can qualify for this feat in other ways, such as by being subjected to a powerful planar effect via the influence of an artifact associated with that plane, being exposed to raw energies from the plane, or even by dying on another plane and being brought back to life in that reality.	DESC:After enduring hardship on another plane, your body, mind, and soul have become infused with that plane’s power.																																	MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:Your body, mind, or soul gains a benefit of some sort as a result of your infusion with the plane of your choice for which you meet the prerequisite. Details on planar infusions can be found below. Planar infusions that take actions to activate are supernatural abilities unless they specifically allow for the use of a spell, in which case they are spell-like abilities. Your caster level for spell-like abilities granted by a planar infusion is equal to your Hit Dice (maximum CL 20th). All other planar infusions are extraordinary abilities. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must select another plane for which you qualify. In cases where the specific effects of Planar Infusion are identical, the effects do not stack.
#Planar Infusion needs MULT set to YES and a CHOOSE to select a plane, also need to build the actual infusions for each plane
Planar Survivor				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																		PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (Planes)=3,Survival=3																																																																																													DESC:Your study of the nature and hazards of a diverse array of planes has prepared you for their dangers.																																			MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks on planes other than the Material Plane and a +2 bonus on saving throws against hazards encountered in such environments. If you have 10 or more ranks in Survival, the bonus on Survival checks increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with the bonus granted by the Self-Sufficient feat.
Planeswalker's Insight			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:You are well versed in the lore of the planes and the psychology of their natives.																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and on Sense Motive checks against outsiders, and Knowledge (planes) is a class skill for you. If you have 10 or more ranks in either of these skills, the bonus for that skill increases to +4. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by the Alertness or Scholar feats.
Primal Bloom				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=10																																																																																															DESC:With a ferocious cry, you call to the First World to render magic unpredictable.																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:31														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can create a 50-foot-radius spread of primal fey influence centered on yourself. This area is stationary and lasts for 1 minute. The affected area gains the wild magic planar trait (see page 63), except that the DC of the caster level check increases by 5. If the area already has the wild magic planar trait, the DC of the caster level check increases by 10 instead. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day once you have 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes) and three times per day once you have 20 ranks in Knowledge (planes).
Shadow's Shroud				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5																																																																																															DESC:You can camouflage yourself in shadows and gloom.																																											MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can shroud yourself in shifting, camouflaging shadow. While shrouded in this fashion, you can attempt Stealth checks as though you had concealment, even in areas of normal or bright light. Creatures that can see normally in supernatural darkness can still see you normally. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive. Unlike spells like shadow walk, which require you to be on a plane that is coterminous with the Shadow Plane, this feat functions even on planes that do not normally share a border with the Shadow Plane. Like all conduit feats, the effects are suppressed when planar travel is forbidden.
Stony Rampart				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Conduit																																																																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:Stone rises up at your command, offering cover to allies.																																										MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can call forth a low wall of unworked stone along any side of a square within 30 feet. This wall is 5 feet long, 3 feet high, 2 inches thick, and acts as a low obstacle, except that it provides only partial cover. A single 5-foot section of stone created by this feat has hardness 8 and 30 hp. You can only have one such wall in existence at a time for every 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) you have (minimum 1); walls last for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes) before crumbling to dust. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (planes), you can create multiple walls as a single standard action by expending an equivalent number of uses of this ability. You can use this feat’s benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).
Stygian Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Stygian spells forsake pure water for the memory-destroying tides of the River Styx.																																						MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:2	SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT: You can enhance any spell with the water descriptor that targets at least one creature to become a Stygian spell. Any creature successfully hit by a Stygian spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against a Stygian spell must succeed at a Will save (using the save DC of the original spell) or suffer the fugue lesser madness in addition to the spell’s normal effects. If the attack is a confirmed critical hit or the original saving throw result is a natural 1, the creature must instead succeed at a Will save (again using the same DC) or suffer the amnesia greater madness. Madness gained this way lasts indefinitely, but can be treated using the normal methods for curing madness. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures native to the River Styx are immune to it. A spell modified by this feat gains the evil descriptor. A Stygian spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the good descriptor can’t be Stygian spells.
Subjective Mobility			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																																																																												PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																																																																																								DESC:You are master of your own gravity in planar realms where gravity is subjective.																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT:You automatically succeed at Wisdom checks to set a new direction of gravity. When you set a new direction of gravity, you can reduce your falling speed by up to twothirds (to a minimum of 50 feet on the first round and 100 feet per round thereafter) or increase it to a maximum of twice normal (300 feet on the first round and 600 feet per round thereafter). These effects only apply on planes with subjective directional gravity.
Subjective Slam				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Subjective Mobility																													PREMULT:1,[PREATT:4],[PRECLASS:1,MONK=3]																																PRESTAT:2,CON=13,WIS=13																																																																																							DESC:When in control of gravity, you can use your momentum to cause brutal impacts, transforming the very act of falling into a devastating weapon.																												MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT:While on a plane with subjective directional gravity, you halve all damage you take from impacts (such as falling damage). While on such a plane, if your “fall” would cause you to collide with a creature or object, you can slam into it with devastating force as a standard action. You must succeed at a touch attack to slam a creature or object, with a cumulative –1 penalty for every 50 feet of your current falling speed; at the GM’s discretion, you can automatically hit vast objects such as walls. A creature or object hit by this slam takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 50 feet of current falling speed, to a maximum of 6d6, and begins falling at your current speed according to your current subjective directional gravity.
Tempting Bargain				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Eidolon																	PRECLASS:1,Unchained Summoner=1																																																																																																																																							DESC:By going against traditional teachings and summoner practices, you have secured the service of an outsider whose morality differs wildly from your own, but you must endure its constant temptations or attempts to redeem you.														MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:32														BENEFIT:You can select an eidolon of any alignment, even if its alignment is more than one step away from your own. Your eidolon never refuses your call as a result of the differences between your respective alignments, though it still can refuse to follow commands that are against its ethos or alignment. Each time you gain a summoner level, you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your eidolon’s Hit Dice + your eidolon’s Charisma modifier). On a failure, your alignment permanently shifts one step closer to that of your eidolon. Modifiers that are not permanent can’t be applied on this saving throw. If your alignment becomes the same as that of your eidolon, you can immediately replace this feat with any other feat you would have qualified for at 1st level. The feat you choose for this must be one approved by the GM, depending on the nature of your eidolon and its influence over you.
Tidal Swiftness				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5																																																																																															DESC:A surge of churning, rushing water from the Plane of Water drives you swiftly across the ground, even in the most arid or frigid of regions. This magically conjured water does not last long once it surges to enhance your speed, but its appearance can certainly astound those unaccustomed to such sights.	MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:33														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can call forth a tide of water that flows around your feet and enhances your speed, as per slipstream. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
Tumultuous Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:You can pour the churning chaos of the Maelstrom into your magic, causing foes to scatter unpredictably, pushed apart in random directions as the unknowable whims of chaos itself, bringing with it strange and unexpected sounds and flashes of unnatural color.									MULT:NO	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1	SOURCEPAGE:33														BENEFIT:You can enhance any spell that targets a single creature to become a tumultuous spell. A creature hit by a tumultuous spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against a tumultuous spell immediately moves 1d4×5 feet in a random direction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this movement would force a creature into a solid object or another creature, the movement ends harmlessly just before impact. A tumultuous spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the lawful descriptor can’t be tumultuous spells.
Tyrant's Rebuke				CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=5																																																																																															DESC:By decree of Asmodeus, Hell is a place antithetical to free will; wielding its power humbles foes and renders them vulnerable to your commands. Those who you target with a pointed rebuke feel as if the disdain of Hell itself has turned its attention to their acts.								MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:33														BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack. A creature successfully hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered until the end of your next turn. If you use Tyrant’s Rebuke on a creature that is already staggered by this effect and it fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in addition to being staggered. You can use this feat once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
Wanderer's Fortune			CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:The promise of Elysium’s freedom liberates you from all forms of restraint, allowing you to move as you will and to avoid numerous kinds of restraints that would otherwise vex a traveler or explorer.																		MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:33														BENEFIT:As a swift action, you gain the benefits of freedom of movement until the end of your turn or until you benefit from the effects to escape a grapple or magical restraint, whichever comes first. You can use this feat’s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
Wind Leaper					CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Conduit																																																																		PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Planes)=3																																																																																															DESC:Energies from the Plane of Air ease your movements and let you make mighty leaps																																						MULT:NO				SOURCEPAGE:33														BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can wrap your body in airy energies. This reduces your effective weight by half. While this ability is active, you gain a circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to half your ranks in Knowledge (planes), you are always treated as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and your Acrobatics checks to high jump are treated as long jumps for the purpose of determining the DC. You can use this feat’s benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
#####
#Each feat takes one line and the first field must be the feat's name. In the Example the name of the feat is Skill Focus.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names feats which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.
