#Worldseeker	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Wizard Archetype.WizardArchetype	DESC:Worldseekers are wizards who travel to all corners of the Great Beyond. While neophytes must content themselves with study and practice, the most powerful worldseekers are movers and shakers throughout the Great Beyond, power players of whom even demigods take note. Worldseekers are rare sights on Golarion, but among those few, more are trained in Kyonin and Nex than any other nation; those in Kyonin explore the potential of using elf gates to travel beyond this realm, while those in Nex emulate some of the dimensional exploits of Nex’s legendary founder. Most worldseekers prefer not to specialize in a school of magic, for having a diverse array of available spells is a boon when exploring the countless wonders of the Great Beyond. Those who do specialize usually do so as conjurers. Conjuration is a poor choice of oppositional school for a worldseeker.

# Worldseeker
#Walk the Planes	KEY:Wizard Archetype Worldseeker ~ Walk the Planes			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.SpellLike				DESC:A worldseeker learns every plane’s place in the Great Beyond and trains to survive even on the harshest of them. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and is constantly under the effects of endure elements. This replaces Scribe Scroll.
#Planar Adaptation	KEY:Wizard Archetype Worldseeker ~ Planar Adaptation			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 8th level, a worldseeker is continually protected from planar environments as by planar adaptation. At 15th level, she can extend that benefit to all allies within 30 feet of her. This replaces the school ability normally gained at 6th or 8th level.
#Planar Associates	KEY:Wizard Archetype Worldseeker ~ Planar Associates			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:A worldseeker’s travels and dealings across the planes allow her to make connections she can call upon when necessary to gain assistance without needing to resort to planar binding. A worldseeker must choose a familiar for her arcane bond. At 5th level, she gains Improved Familiar as a bonus feat and must choose an outsider familiar that matches her alignment exactly; she can choose an outsider in this way even if it normally requires a 7th-level spellcaster as its master. At 7th level, a worldseeker automatically learns lesser planar ally as a 4th-level wizard spell. She automatically learns planar ally as a 6th-level wizard spell at 11th level, and greater planar ally as an 8th-level wizard spell at 15th level. She can swap out a prepared spell of an equal spell level to spontaneously cast any of these three spells (one 4th-level spell for lesser planar ally, a 6th-level spell for planar ally, and a 8th level spell for greater planar ally). The first time each day she casts one of these three spells, the worldseeker reduces the gp value of the material component cost by an amount equal to her caster level x 100 (to a minimum cost of 0 gp). This alters arcane bond and replaces the bonus feat gained at 5th level.
#Planar Redoubt	KEY:Wizard Archetype Worldseeker ~ Planar Redoubt			SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:At 15th level, a worldseeker creates a planar redoubt, a personal demiplane to which she can retreat to rest and plan. This functions like lesser create demiplane, except the demiplane is up to a single 50-foot cube in size and is permanent. This replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level.
